# ðŸŽ§ MoodOS: Your Emotional Operating System

**MoodOS** is a deep learningâ€“powered web application that detects your **inner emotional state** from your **voice** â€” either through uploading `.wav` files or recording in real-time.

Unlike traditional NLP-based sentiment models, **MoodOS is sentence-agnostic** â€” it listens to **tone, pitch, rhythm, and frequency** patterns rather than the words you say.

## Features

- **Real-time microphone emotion detection**
- **.wav file upload support**
- **Custom CNN architecture trained on MFCC features**
- **Emotion prediction with confidence scores**
- **Mood Journal to track your emotional patterns**
- **Personalized suggestions based on detected emotion**
- **Clean UI with waveform and probability visualizations**

---

## How It Works

MoodOS uses **MFCC-based preprocessing** to extract important audio features like:

- **Pitch modulation**
- **Spectral energy**
- **Voice intensity**
- **Mel-frequency cepstral coefficients (MFCCs)**

These are passed into a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** trained on a diverse emotional speech dataset. The model achieved **99.9% validation accuracy** during training.

It detects the following emotions:

> `Happy, Sad, Angry, Fearful, Neutral, Disgust`
